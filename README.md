Hey folks,


This is my implementation of a circular queue in C. It's primary functionality 
is to calculate the running average of an nth term provided by the user.

cd into the Queue directory and run make to generate a "circle" executable.

Once run: 
  - User will be prompted to enter the nth term to average over.
  - User will be prompted to enter a value into the buffer.

Each iteration:
  - Prompt user to add a value.
  - After entering a value, display:
      - Contents of the queue.
      - Resultant running average calculation.
      - Value of the head pointer.

Will run until exited with CTRL + C.


THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY!
