Hey folks,

This is my implementation of a circular queue in C. 


The primary functionality of this code 
is to take a running 
average of an nth term provided by the user.


cd into the Queue directory and run make to generate an executable named "circle".

Once run: 
  - User will be prompted to enter the nth term to average over.
  - User will be prompted to enter a value into the buffer.
  
  
Each iteration:
  - Prompt user to add a value.
  - After entering a value:
      - Each iteration will display the contents of the queue.
      - The resultant running average calculation.
      - The value of the head pointer.
    
Will run until exited with CTRL + C.

THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY!
